# PlateVision_CV

#Project Overview

PlateVision is a computer vision project that aims to reduce food waste by analyzing food images and classifying their consumption status.
The system helps organizations understand food usage patterns and make better decisions to minimize waste.

#Project Goal

To detect and classify food conditions using deep learning, supporting data-driven decisions and sustainability.

Model Used

YOLOv8 (Classification Model)

Fine-tuned on a custom food dataset

Optimized for accuracy and lightweight deployment

#Project Structure

app.py → Application file for running the model

best_model.pt → Trained classification model

mobilenet_final.ipynb → Model training and experimentation notebook

# How It Works

Input food images into the system

Model classifies food condition

Results help analyze food waste patterns

Output

Food classification results

Insights to support waste reduction strategies

# Future Improvements

Improve accuracy with more data

Add real-time deployment

Extend to multiple food categories
